# imdb_classification
An implementation of the classic movie review classification problem with deep learning. This is a very classic deep learning model described in Francois Chollet's awesome book "Deep Learning in Python." I read this book ravenously in about a week so I could learn deep learning for my internship at the NIH. I wrote this about six months ago, but wanted to import it from my repl.it account for visiblility. Brings back good memories!
